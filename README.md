# SaucisseTracker

Work in progress item tracker for randomizers. Aims to be customizable easily with a built-in editor and import/export capabilities.

## Requirements

- Python (3.10+)
- PyQt6
- Pillow

## Features

Available:
- Use a configuration file to define the background image, the different elements of the tracker and the cosmetics
- External font support
- The windows' size is based on the background size
- Upgrade tiers available through the counter system
- Progressive items available with the source paths of an item
- Import and export the tracker's state

Planned:
- Editor to make configurations easier
- Reward system (like medallions and stones for OoT)

## Project Structure

* Files:
    - ``src/common.py``: hosts classes and functions that can be used in any other file
    - ``src/config.py``: handles reading the configuration file and storing the informations in classes
    - ``src/main.py``: the main window's logic is handled there (creating and updating the window/widgets/menus)
    - ``src/state.py``: handles importing and exporting savestates

* Folders:
    - ``res/``: the program's resources (packed when building)
    - ``config/``: the tracker's configurations data, currently only hosting one example config file (not packed when building)
    - ``.github/``: hosts the GitHub workflows (to provide automated builds and releases)
    - ``.vscode/``: settings and launch profiles for Visual Studio Code

## State File Structure

**WARNING**: do NOT edit this file manually unless you know what you're doing.

The save state file is a plain text file containing informations about how to restore the progression on the tracker.

* ``Label #XX``: the items are drawn using QLabel's pixmap, the X represent the index of the label.
    - ``pos_index``: the position index, used to know which label to update when there's multiple labels with the same index
    - ``name``: the item's name, used to determine if there's a mismatch between the configuration and the save (also useful to know what's the current label corresponding to)
    - ``enabled``: used to know if the black and white filter should be applied or not
    - ``img_index``: the index of the image, used for progressive items
    - ``counter_value``: the value of the counter, if used
    - ``counter_show``: the visibility of the counter, if used

## Config File Structure

* ``<Config>``: declares a new config
    - ``DefaultInventory``: the index to the default inventory settings to use
    - ``StatePath``: optional, can be used to set a path to save and load the tracker's state, skips the file dialogs if used
* ``<Fonts>``: list of external fonts to use
    - ``<Item>``: an element of the list
        * ``Index``: the index of the font
        * ``Name``: the name of the font (same name as the one that shows in the font preview)
        * ``Source``: the path to the font file (.ttf/.otf)
* ``<TextSettings>``: list of text settings, controls bold, size, default/max colors and the font to use
    - ``<Item>``: an element of the list
        * ``Index``: the index of the setting
        * ``Name``: the name of the setting
        * ``FontIndex``: the font index to specify which font to use
        * ``Size``: the size of the text
        * ``Bold``: toggles bold on the text
        * ``Color``: the default color, usually white (0xFFFFFF)
        * ``ColorMax``: the color to use when reaching the maximum value (for counters for instance), usually green (0x00FF00)
* ``<Inventory>``:
    - ``Index``: the index of the inventory
    - ``Name``: the name of the inventory configuration
    - ``Background``: the background image to use for this inventory
    - ``<Item>``: an element of the list
        * ``Pos``: optional if using ``<Positions>``, defines the X and Y position in the window (format: ``Pos="X;Y"``)
        * ``Name``: the name of the inventory item
        * ``Source``: optional if using ``<Sources>``, defines the path to the texture to use for this item
        * ``Enabled``: optional, can be used to enable an item by default
        * ``<Counter>``: optional, declares a new counter for this item
            - ``TextSettings``: the index of the text setting to use for this counter
            - ``Min``: the lowest amount the counter can take
            - ``Max``: the highest amount the counter can take
            - ``Increment``: how much it's adding/substracting when the item gets updated
        * ``<Sources>``: optional if using ``Source``, list of texture paths
            - ``<Item>``: an element of the list
                * ``Path``: the path to the texture
        * ``<Positions>``: optional if using ``Pos``, list of positions, this will use the same set of sources to draw N items, N being the number of elements of that list
            - ``<Item>``: an element of the list
                * ``X``: the position on the X axis
                * ``Y``: the position on the Y axis

## Creating a configuration

To create your own configuration, start by creating a directory named ``config``. For executable builds you need to place it in the folder where the executable is located, if running from source it needs to be in the same folder where the ``src`` folder is (see how this repository does this)

Next, add a subfolder in the folder you just created, the name doesn't matter. Every file in this subfolder can be named and organised like you want, the only file that requires a fixed path and name is ``config.xml``, that should be located at the top-level of the config's subfolder (example: ``config/oot/config.xml``)

See the configuration file's documentation to learn more about how to create your own configuration (manually at least), an example is provided in this repo (look inside the ``config`` folder)

The background image's width and height will be used to set the window's width and height.
