# SaucisseTracker

Work in progress item tracker for randomizers. Aims to be customizable easily with a built-in editor and import/export capabilities.

## Requirements

- Python (3.10+)
- PyQt6
- Pillow

## Features

Available:
- Use a configuration file to define the background image, the different elements of the tracker and the cosmetics
- External font support
- The windows' size is based on the background size
- Upgrade tiers available through the counter system
- Progressive items available with the source paths of an item
- Import and export the tracker's state
- Dungeon reward system
- Flag system to add extra text
- Checkmarks with right click
- Main menu where you can choose which configuration you want to use

Planned:
- Editor to make configurations easier

## Project Structure

* Files:
    - ``src/common.py``: hosts classes and functions that can be used in any other file
    - ``src/config.py``: handles reading the configuration file and storing the informations in classes
    - ``src/main.py``: the main menu and the starting point of the program
    - ``src/state.py``: handles importing and exporting savestates
    - ``src/tracker.py``: the tracker window's logic is handled there (creating and updating the window/widgets/menus)

* Folders:
    - ``res/``: the program's resources (packed when building)
    - ``config/``: the tracker's configurations data, currently only hosting one example config file (not packed when building)
    - ``.github/``: hosts the GitHub workflows (to provide automated builds and releases)
    - ``.vscode/``: settings and launch profiles for Visual Studio Code

## State File Structure

**WARNING**: do NOT edit this file manually unless you know what you're doing.

The save state file is a plain text file containing informations about how to restore the progression on the tracker.

* ``Global Settings``:
    - ``gomode_visibility``: the visibility of the "go mode"
    - ``gomode_light_visibility``: the visibility of the light effect, if used
* ``Label #XX``: the items are drawn using QLabel's pixmap, the X represent the index of the label.
    - ``pos_index``: the position index, used to know which label to update when there's multiple labels with the same index
    - ``name``: the item's name, used to determine if there's a mismatch between the configuration and the save (also useful to know what's the current label corresponding to)
    - ``enabled``: used to know if the black and white filter should be applied or not
    - ``img_index``: the index of the image, used for progressive items
    - ``counter_value``: the value of the counter, if used
    - ``counter_show``: the visibility of the counter, if used
    - ``reward_index``: the index of reward name to display
    - ``flag_index``: the index of the flag the item uses
    - ``flag_text_index``: the index of the flag's text to display
    - ``show_flag``: the visibility of the flag
    - ``show_extra_img``: the visibility of the extra image (if used)

## Creating a configuration

To create your own configuration, start by creating a directory named ``config``. For executable builds you need to place it in the folder where the executable is located, if running from source it needs to be in the same folder where the ``src`` folder is (see how this repository does this)

Next, add a subfolder in the folder you just created, the name doesn't matter. Every file in this subfolder can be named and organised like you want, the only file that requires a fixed path and name is ``config.xml``, that should be located at the top-level of the config's subfolder (example: ``config/oot/config.xml``)

See the configuration file's documentation to learn more about how to create your own configuration (manually at least), an example is provided in this repo (look inside the ``config`` folder)

The background image's width and height will be used to set the window's width and height.

## Contributing

Any help is welcome!

If you wish to add support for another file format (for config files):
- go in the ``__init__`` function of the class named ``Config`` in ``config.py``
- create a new function called ``parse_FORMAT_config``, it requires at least one parameter called ``self`` (``def parse_FORMAT_config(self)``)
- find ``match self.config_path.suffix``, then add a case with the file extension of the format you want to add (like ``.json`` or ``.yml`` for example)
- call the function you created in this new case (``self.parse_FORMAT_config()``)
